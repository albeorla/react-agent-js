### Story: Pinecone Vector Database Integration with LangGraph
**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Priority**: High  
**Epic**: Infrastructure

As a developer using the LangGraph ReAct agent,
I want to integrate Pinecone vector database capabilities,
So that I can store and retrieve vector embeddings for semantic search and memory.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] Add Pinecone client dependency
- [x] Configure Pinecone environment variables
- [x] Create a Pinecone index initialization module
- [x] Add vector storage and retrieval utilities
- [x] Update documentation with Pinecone setup instructions
- [x] Add example usage in README
- [x] Add and verify test coverage

**Technical Notes**:
- Using @pinecone-database/pinecone for TypeScript integration
- Index configured for OpenAI embeddings (1536 dimensions)
- Supports both upsert and query operations with metadata
- Test coverage includes:
  - Successful vector operations
  - Error handling for malformed inputs
  - Dimension validation (1536d requirement)

**Development Progress**:
- ðŸ“… Started: December 24, 2024
- ðŸ“… Completed: December 24, 2024
- ðŸ”„ Updates:
  - Initial story creation and planning (Dec 24)
  - Added Pinecone dependency and environment variables (Dec 24)
  - Created vector_store.ts module with initialization and utility functions (Dec 24)
  - Added documentation for Pinecone setup (Dec 24)
  - Implemented type-safe vector operations (upsert and query) (Dec 24)
  - Added comprehensive test suite (Dec 24)
  - Verified all tests passing (Dec 24)

**Next Steps**:
1. Consider adding delete operations
2. Add example embeddings generation
